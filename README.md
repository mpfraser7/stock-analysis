# stock-analysis
## VBA Challenge

### Overview of Project
Initially, I wrote a VBA code that analyzes a list of 12 stocks. The analysis provides the daily volume and return % for each stock, based on the fiscal year provided in a message box. The purpose of the challenge was to refactor the code and make it run quicker. Instead of going through the entire database 12 times, once for each stock, the refactored code only goes through the database once while storing the important values in variables. The result of the refactored code is explained below.

### Results
First, let's talk about the stock performance, comparing year 2017 with 2018. The average volume and total volume for all stocks is very similar from year to year. However, the return % is drastically different. In 2017, the average return is 67%, compared to -9% in 2018. The best performing stock in 2017 was DQ. The best performing stock in 2018 was RUN.




Now, let's talk about the difference between the old code and the refactored code.
